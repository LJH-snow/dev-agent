# dev-agent

An AI coding agent for developers, built with TypeScript and Node.js.

Phase 1 is a pnpm workspace monorepo made of small TypeScript packages. Low-level
capabilities such as sandboxing, process isolation, and filesystem security live
in the Rust runtime under `runtime/rust`; the macOS backend is active, and Linux
backend support is planned next.

## Getting Started

Requires Node.js >= 20 and pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm cli -- --version
```

## Current Status
- Phase 1 workspace skeleton with pnpm monorepo TypeScript setup
- Agent loop, context, and in-memory memory in `@dev-agent/agent-core`
- File-backed memory in `@dev-agent/agent-core` for cross-run conversation history,
  with session metadata (created/last-active timestamps) and `--compact` support
- CLI session isolation and reset via `--session` and `--reset-memory`
- Rich agent context with session id, working directory, metadata, task, and error state
- Context-aware built-in tools that run relative to `workingDirectory`
- `code-search` tool that scans TypeScript/JavaScript symbols in the project
- MCP server environment injection for session id and working directory
- TypeScript AST scanner in `@dev-agent/code-intelligence` for functions, classes,
  interfaces, type aliases, enums, methods, properties, variables, and arrow functions
- `InMemoryCodeIndex` with improved ranking: case-sensitive exact-match bonus,
  test-file demotion, and path-depth penalty in `@dev-agent/code-intelligence`
- `JsonFileCodeIndex` with JSON persistence and incremental updates
- `TypeScriptReferenceIndex` for reference search and go-to-definition via the
  TypeScript language service in `@dev-agent/code-intelligence`
- `code-search` tool now supports `search` (default), `references`, and `definition`
- Model contracts plus OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama providers in `@dev-agent/model`
- Built-in filesystem, shell, git, and search tools in `@dev-agent/tools`
- Executor contract in `@dev-agent/executor` with `cwd`, `env`, stdin `input`,
  `timeoutMs`, `durationMs`, and `command` on `LocalExecutor`; optional execution
  history via `historyLimit`. `RustExecutor` implements `SandboxExecutor` over the
  protobuf stdio boundary
- Stdio MCP client with reconnect backoff, notification debounce, structured error
  codes (`McpRequestError`), and graceful close in `@dev-agent/mcp`
- MCP resources, prompts, capability negotiation, and roots handling
- CLI entry point wired to the loop with `--once`, `--tools`, `--metadata`,
  `--compact`, and Ctrl-C interrupt handling. Agent loop exposes `onTurn` callback
  for streaming progress
- Policy language: the Rust sandbox uses **Starlark** for filesystem/network/policy
  rules, consistent with the open-source Codex agent
- Rust runtime boundary is active: `runtime/rust` has a `dev-agent-runtime`
  crate with `LocalExecutor`, `SandboxExecutor`, a `dev-agent-executor` stdio
  binary, and a protobuf protocol (`proto/executor.proto`)
- macOS `sandbox-exec` enforcement is active for filesystem, network, timeout,
  and resource limits. Linux bubblewrap backend is planned next
- Test suite: 90 TypeScript tests + 26 Rust tests, all passing

### Rust runtime progress

- Starlark policy evaluation with `starlark 0.14`, tick/heap limits, and `ctx` bindings
- macOS `sandbox-exec` enforcement: writable/read-only paths, network policy, cwd,
  timeout, and resource limits (CPU, FSIZE, NOFILE, NPROC, CORE)
- Linux placeholder detects `bwrap` availability for clearer error messages
## Roadmap

1. ~~Richer code index and reference search~~ (done: improved ranking, persistent `JsonFileCodeIndex`)
2. ~~MCP resources, prompts, and richer server lifecycle~~ (done: debounce, backoff, structured errors)
3. Rust runtime under `runtime/rust`, implemented behind the `SandboxExecutor` contract.
   Sandbox and filesystem policies are authored in **Starlark** (the same
   approach used by the open-source Codex agent), evaluated at runtime by an
   embedded Starlark interpreter in Rust. Starlark `policy` evaluation is now
   implemented and tested; macOS `sandbox-exec` enforcement is now active for
   filesystem, network, timeout, and resource limits. The next backend to add
   is Linux bubblewrap/seccomp support
4. Desktop shell in `apps/desktop`
5. CLI streaming output and session management hardening
